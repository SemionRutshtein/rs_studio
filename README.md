# Red Stone Studio — Official Website

Personal studio website for Semion Rutshtein, founder of Red Stone Studio (Bat Yam, Israel).
Showcases AI automation, intelligent bots, database architecture, and web development services.

Built as a single-file vanilla HTML/CSS/JS page with full animation suite — 
particle canvas, scroll reveal, counter animations, infinite marquee, and SVG network diagrams.
No frameworks. No build tools. Just fast, clean, production-grade frontend code.
